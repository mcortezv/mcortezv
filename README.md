# 👨‍💻 Manuel de Jesus Cortez Villa

I have experience in the development of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Models using Python and Scikit-Learn. My focus includes Data Preprocessing, the implementation of prediction and classification algorithms such as Linear Regression, Classification Forests, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Additionally, I work with techniques for Data Scaling, Balancing, and Stratification. I validate models using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R², Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, and F1 Score.
